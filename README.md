# TF2-GradientTape-Examples
This Repository Contains examples for Tensorflow 2.x Eager execution (GradientTape) techniques and examples contain ANN, CNN, RNN models with entire Tensorflow ETL pipeline. Using Eager Executions it will be able to generate dynamic graphs instead of static graphs like in tensorflow older versions

# Create python environment and install tensorflow
conda create -n envname  python=python_version</br>
activate envname  
conda install -c anaconda tensorflow-gpu
